\section{Introduction}
  \subsection{Internet of Things}
  Internet of Things or commonly referred to as IoT defines a paradigm in which 'everyday' devices can be connected 
  together in a network and thus can communicate with each other over the Internet. Moreover the connected devices are equipped 
  with 'identifying', 'sensing' and 'processing' \cite{Whitmore-survey}
  capabilites which enable them to 
  acheive some objective or complete some assigned task. Nowadays IoT is widely used in applications like
  healthcare, utilities, transport, etc. The revolution in the field of IoT has enabled
  these devices to have interaction capabilites too i.e. they can be controlled, actuated and commanded.
  \cite{Gubbi-vision}. 
  \par The components of IoT broadly are Hardware, Software and Architecture. Hardware refers to the component/s
  or the device/s which constitue the system which has been designed to acheive some objective, Software refers roughly
  to the support which enables the devices in the system to exchange and process data inspite of their heterogeniety 
   %\cite{Whitmore-survey}
   and Architecture provides the specifications so that information transfer and processing
   and networking of devices can be done in a standard fashion  \cite{Whitmore-survey} \cite{Gubbi-vision}.
  \par In healthcare applications, IoT can be used to monitor a patient's health condtion over the Internet, and 
  in case of critical patients the sensors placed on the patient can transmit and make information available continuously
  to the doctors and patient's relatives which will lead to better monitoring and enable doctors to take timely action
  in case of emergencies. IoT has already made its mark in making 'smart homes' where sensors and actuators placed in 
  the house or building complex continuously monitor and control the resource consumption and also fulfil security needs.
  On a broader scale, IoT can be deployed to make 'smart cities' in which everything starting from traffic to the levels 
  of pollution can be monitored and controlled \cite{Whitmore-survey}. 
  \par Even in the industries IoT can be used for quality management and tracking of goods, say using Radio Frequency
  Identification( RFID ). In can be used in hazardous industries, say the mining industry, to improve the safety level
  by monitoring the condition inside the mine via sensors and continuously process the data and .
